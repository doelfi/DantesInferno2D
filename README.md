# ![Dante](https://github.com/doelfi/Unity/assets/91377218/24d3af5d-f64d-49c1-80c8-3013f73f6c69) Dante's Inferno 2D

Dante's Inferno 2D is a jump and run game following Dante through the circles of hell. Each circle bares its own obstacles varying from dangerous spikes to insidious enemies attacking Dante. 
But neither can stop Dantes curiosity for the next circle of hell. So press start and join Dante on his journey through hell. 


Starting in circle 1 Limbo, the first circle, one gets used to playing by following a simple tutorial. 
In Lust, the second circle, the first enemy occurs. 
Then, in Gluttony, precise jumping skills are required to reach the next level. 
Afterwards, the fourth circle Greed shows who has a good balance and who dares to collect another coin. 
Getting closer to the end circle no. 5 Anger provokes the player even more - it is hell after all. 
Last but not least, the name of the last circle Fraud already tells that not everything is as it seems. 

So be careful and don't die - 
to keep hell away.
